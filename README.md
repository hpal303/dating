Changes needed are:-
____________________
(1)<<<<<<<
University screen is edited as shown in 0.University jpeg
this screen needs addition in dart file of 'Course' name and 'University email ID' where OTP would be sent using Firebase OTP sending feature to email.

(2)<<<<<<<
1 to 6 jpeg screens come up in same order of 1 to 6, but only after 'Enable location' screen has appeared and user has given input in it.
6th screen needs addition of 'Job Title' in dart file
('Living in' and 'Born in' Country and Location will remain same by default. but can be changed by user later. 
8th jpeg of 'setting' has both locations. also they show in 9th jpeg on Summary of Profile 'Information.dart')

As there is a matching criteria for sexual orientation same way there should be one more criteria for 'Looking for'
Where profiles looking for same thing (Dating/marriage/friendship) should be shown first. Later others can be shown too.


(3)<<<<<<<
As soon as the 6th screen of 'work' gets input from user then the 7th Jpeg 'EditInfo.dart'/ Summary of profile comes which shows photos on top 
3.1) Need to reduce pictures total count from 9 to 6
3.2) 'Edit Info' screen needs data to be parired so needs Addition of 3 Headings : My Choices, My Interests, My Bio
 ---'My Choices' takes input from 1 to 6 jpeg screens mentioned in 2nd point above
 ---'My Interests' selection code i am uploading as saw it online. that can be used directly here when user click on 'My Interests that will be blank initially.
 ---'My Bio' is already codes just need to add 'Born in country and flutter icon baby_changing_station
 
(4)<<<<<<<
in 9th Jpeg of 'Summary Visible to others' which seems to be from 'information.dart' or 'profile folder'
it needs 5 additions:-
4.1) Looking for info in blue
4.2) Addition of 3 Headings My Interests, My Choices, My Bio

in 8th jpeg of 'settings' shows 2 extra information
-- University email that was already verified
